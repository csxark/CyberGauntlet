# Sample Test Cases for Pair Sum Algorithm

## Test Case 1
Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
Target: 6
Expected pairs: (2,4)
Count: 1

## Test Case 2  
Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Target: 8
Expected pairs: (1,7), (2,6), (3,5)
Count: 3

## Test Case 3
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Target: 10
Expected pairs: (1,9), (3,7)
Count: 2

## Test Case 4
Array: [2, 4, 6, 8]
Target: 15
Expected pairs: none
Count: 0

## Algorithm Efficiency Requirement
- Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through array
- Space Complexity: O(1) - constant extra space
- Method: Two pointers technique (one from start, one from end)
